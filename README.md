# Web Development Learning

This repository documents my web development learning journey.
It contains small projects and practice work created while learning
frontend fundamentals.

Main portfolio-ready projects are maintained in separate repositories.

## Folder Structure

- html-css/  
  HTML and CSS projects focused on layout, responsiveness, and UI components

- javascript/  
  JavaScript practice and mini projects (to be added)

- react/  
  React components and small applications (to be added)

## Purpose

- Track learning progress
- Practice concepts through hands-on projects
- Maintain clean separation between learning work and main portfolio projects
